# Bootstrap Portfolio - Myriam Martin

## Description

In this challenge, I've built a responsive portfolio using the Bootstrap 5 CSS Framework to put into practice the utility classes, color, components such as navbar, forms, cards, Bootstrap flexbox classes and Bootstrap grid system that we've learned during the third week of the boot camp.

## Table of content

- Navigation bar
- Navigation Menu
- Hero Section
- Selected Work Section
- Skills Section
- About Section
- Contact Section
- Footer - Social Media Section

## Usage

My portfolio page consists of the following sections:

- A Navigation bar at the top of the page with my name on it and a menu with link items that linked to the appropriate sections.
- Below the navigation bar you can find the Hero section with an image the name of the business a CTA that links to the contact section with a form component at the bottom of the page.
- Following the Hero section there is a section with the Selected work. I've used the Bootstrap card component with a brief overview of each of them, which will be updated in the near future.
- Once you scrolled down the portfolio section you can see a list of Skills in grid which I'll be gaining and perfecting during these weeks in the bootcamp.
- Both the About and Contact section have been build using flexbox bootstrap classes and offset, with no need of media queries.
- Contact section also included with a form component
- At the bottom of the page the Footer Section a list of social media can be founds and also the option to go back to the top of the page.
