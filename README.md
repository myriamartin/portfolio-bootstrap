# Bootstrap Portfolio - Myriam Martin

## Description

My goal in this challenge is to use the Bootstrap 5 frontend CSS and JavaScript Framework to build a responsive portfolio that incorporates the skills learned during the third week of boot camp, such as utility classes, color schemes, components such as navbars, forms, cards, Bootstrap flexbox classes, and the Bootstrap CSS responsive grid system.

## Table of content

- Navigation bar
- Navigation Menu
- Hero Section
- Selected Work Section
- Skills Section
- About Section
- Contact Section
- Footer - Social Media links

## Usage

On my portfolio page, you will find the following sections:

- On the top of the page you will find a navigation bar with my name and a menu with links to the various sections.
- Located below the navigation bar is a Hero section with an image, the business name, and a call-to-action that links to the contact form.
- Immediately following the Hero section is the Selected work section. I have used the Bootstrap card component and provided a brief overview of each, which will be updated soon.
- As you scroll down the portfolio, you will find a list of Skills, which I'll be gaining and polishing over the next few weeks in the boot camp.
- Both the About and Contact sections are built using the bootstrap grid layout and flexbox bootstrap classes, without the need for media queries. The contact section also includes a form component.
- Located in the footer section there is a list of social media networks at the bottom of the page, along with an option to return to the top of the page.
